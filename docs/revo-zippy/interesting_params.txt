Interesting parameters

SPEED_MAX
GUID_OPTIONS  set bit 6 (64 in decimal) for s-curves for navigation

LOIT_TYPE  If you don't have a reversing ESC set to 1 which means always face bow towards target in loiter

WP_ACCEL may affect speed in turns
WP_RADIUS  could try modifying

change ARMING_RUDDER to 1 from 2 2 is arm or disarm 1 is arming only. Maybe that is the disarming issue!
