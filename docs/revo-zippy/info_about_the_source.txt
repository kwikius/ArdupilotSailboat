Ardupilot Rover Sailboat functionality

an object of Sailboat class is declared in the ParametersG2 object
access using

   rover.g2.sailboat.f(...)

check if in sailboat mode via

   rover.g2.sailboat.sail_enabled()
   
   In sailboat 
   
   
   
In Sailboat::init() , shouldnt everything be dependent on sailboat.sail_enable();
  
  The sailboat.tack_enabled checks for sail_enabled()
  
  if sailboat.enabled() == false
  The sailboat.motor assist() will warn "Sailboat: failed to enable motor"
  and any of various conditions in sailboat.motor_assist() are true
  
  Similarly couldnt the Rover::init_ardupilot only call sailboat.init() if sailboat.sail_enable() == true
